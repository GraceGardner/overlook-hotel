## Abstract  
Overlook hotel is a simple hotel room reservation project.

## Project Specs  

It allows a user to login with their user name and password. They are then taken to their account which displays their booking history and the total that they have spent with the hotel. From there they can navigate to check rooms by date and type. If a room is available meeting their criteria they will be able to book a room.
